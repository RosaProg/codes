s:674:"<p>This creates a slide show of up to twelve slides for you to promote important elements of your site.  The show is responsive where image height is set according to screen size.  The recommended height is 418px.  The width is set at 100% and therefore the actual height will be smaller if the width is greater than the screen size.  At smaller screen sizes the height is reduced dynamically without the need to provide separate images.  For reference screen width &lt; 767px = height 438px, width between 768px and 979px = height 418px and width &gt; 980px = height 418px.  If no image is selected for a slide, then the default_slide images in the pix folder is used.</p>
