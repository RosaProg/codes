Dear <%=@user.first_name%>,

Welcome to  and thanks for joining our effort to produce

In the meantime, here are some ideas on how to get started:

1. Start a pitch:  Traditionally you would pitch editors, because they
were the only people that had a freelance budget.  At  community
members band together to build a budget of their own.  Now you can pitch
the public to do the journalism you want! 

2. Check out other stories that are up on  and see if you want to support any of them.

3. Click "Free Credits" and help fund a story without spending a dime!
