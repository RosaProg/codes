Dear <%=@user.first_name%>,

Welcome to  and thanks for joining our effort to produce
community funded journalism.

We apologize for the slight delay in approving your account. News
Organizations are the ONLY type of account that we grant special
privileges to and as a result we are very careful about who is given a
"news organization" account on 

But now that you are in - we work for you!

If you have any questions - don't hesitate to contact <%=get_email(:info)%>

In the meantime - here are some ideas on how to get started.

Start a pitch: You could use this to raise money for a freelancer.
Perhaps a freelance reporter has already created a pitch that would 
be of interest to you. Your donation could turn it into
a reality.

You can get more ideas at our FAQ: http:///pages/about#faq_news_organization

Sincerely,
<%=get_name(:info)%>
